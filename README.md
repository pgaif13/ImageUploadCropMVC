ImageUploadCropMVC
==================

Sample .Net application to upload, crop and saved cropped images to a server. Developed using C# and the MVC4 Framework.

This application uses Jcrop and Jquery to manage the User Interface and contains the server side code required to crop the images based on the application parameters.

This project contains two child projects that can be opened with Visual Studio: the main Aplication Project (PassPhotoMVC4) and the associated Unit Tests Project (PassPhotoMVC4.Tests).
